Project: Barista Trainer

Modules that need to be installed: Pygame. To install pygame, I used the module installation guide that was posted on the 15-112 piazza page.

About: My project is basically a game in which players need to catch ingredients to follow a recipe. They must finish their shift in order to complete the game.
